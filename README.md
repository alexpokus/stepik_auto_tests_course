# stepik_auto_tests_course

The course contains theory in text format, but still it is focused specifically on practice. This is a real "school for a young fighter": you will write many lines of code, analyze many tricky situations and catch various tricky bugs. And at the end of the course, you will have a small test project: this is the final assignment of the course, for which you will receive the most points. This project can be attached to your resume as a demonstration of your skills for a future employer.
